# Release Announcement: LinkStash v1.0.0 ðŸš€

I'm excited to announce the official release of **LinkStash v1.0.0**! ðŸŽ‰

**LinkStash** is my self-hosted, backend-driven bookmarking and "read it later" solution, designed to give you complete control over your saved links and offline content. This has been a passion project of mine, and Iâ€™m proud to finally share it with the world.

## What's New in v1.0.0?
Everything!

V1.0.0 is the initial release, focusing on the core functionality of a bookmark manager.

Features:
- **Bookmark Management:** Save and organize your links with tags.
- **Archive Mode:** Save articles for offline access. 
- **Self-Hosting:** Simplified deployment with Docker Compose
- **REST API:** Backend first, all functionality available as REST endpoint.

## Get Started Now
You can get started quickly with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   mkdir config
   mkdir archive
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmadfarhan1981/linkstash/develop/docker/docker-compose.yaml
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Iâ€™ve got a long list of improvements and features I plan to add over time, but for now, I just want to get LinkStash in front of people and hear your thoughts. 

If you have any feedback or bug reports, Iâ€™d really appreciate it if you let me know.
